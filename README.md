The [OntoUML Vocabulary](https://w3id.org/ontouml/vocabulary) is an implementation of the [OntoUML Metamodel](https://w3id.org/ontouml/metamodel) in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) that is easily interoperable with [ontouml-js](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-js) and [ontouml-schema](https://w3id.org/ontouml/schema).

This vocabulary supports the serialization, exchange, and publishing of OntoUML models as linked data and is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
