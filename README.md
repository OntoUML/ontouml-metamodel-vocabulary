# The OntoUML Vocabulary

The [OntoUML Vocabulary](https://w3id.org/ontouml/vocabulary) is an implementation of the [OntoUML Metamodel](https://w3id.org/ontouml/metamodel) in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) compliant with the [ontouml-js](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-js) and the [ontouml-schema](https://w3id.org/ontouml/schema).

This vocabulary supports the serialization, exchange, and publishing of OntoUML models as linked data and is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

## Documentation

The complete documentation of the OntoUML Vocabulary generated with [PyLODE](https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE) is available on this link: https://w3id.org/ontouml/vocabulary/doc

## Employment in Projects

The [OntoUML/UFO Catalog](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-models) uses the OntoUML Vocabulary for the TTL serialization of its models.

The FAIR Model Catalog for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling Research, short-named OntoUML/UFO Catalog, is a structured and open-source catalog that contains OntoUML and UFO ontology models. It was conceived to allow collaborative work and to be easily accessible to all its users.

## Related Computational Tools

The [OntoUML JSON2Graph Decoder](https://w3id.org/ontouml/json2graph) provides a transformation from data encoded as JSON according to the [ontouml-schema](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-schema) to a graph format (e.g., TTL) in compliance with the OntoUML Vocabulary.
