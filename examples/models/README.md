# Examples

The examples here provided were taken from the [OntoUML/UFO Catalog](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-models).

The JSON files were converted to TTL using the [ontouml-json2ttl](https://w3id.org/ontouml/json2graph) decoder. This tool generates graph files that comply with the OntoUML Vocabulary and includes an optional basic verification and correction. 

Two examples are provided for each ontology tested, one without using the correction feature (generated files have the ontology's catalog folder name) and the other one using it (same name added by '-c'). Both the resulting TTL file and the yielded LOG are here available.
