# Examples

Two different types of examples are here presented: individual objects and complete models.

## Individual Objects

The transformation of specific types of JSON objects are presented in individual `.ttl` files.

## Complete Models

The examples here provided were taken from the [OntoUML/UFO Catalog](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-models).

The JSON files were converted to TTL using the [ontouml-json2ttl](https://w3id.org/ontouml/json2graph) decoder. This tool generates graph files that comply with the OntoUML Vocabulary and includes an optional basic verification and correction. Both the resulting `.ttl` file and the yielded `.log` generated by the decoder are here available.
